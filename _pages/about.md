I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Queen's University. I have programming experience in C, Python (including libraries such as OpenCV and Keras), Java, VHDL, and Assembly Language Programming. I am not a web developer - but I learn quickly and love problem solving! I have professional experience developing mechatronics undergraduate labs and educational material, I VP-Training on Queen's Merlin Neurotechnology Design Team, and I am currently working as an IT specialist developing corporate resources for a large-scale company-wide cloud migration.

This site will soon be updated with interactive features to learn more about my past work and my current goals as a student and engineer.
